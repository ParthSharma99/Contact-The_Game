# Contact - The Game

The challenge in working on this game began with modifying it to make it mobile compatible so players from around the globe can play the same game with each other in real-time.

Converting Conversational games into mobile application is a huge task and it normally ends up in a new game, losing its original identity in most cases. We retained the original game as much as possible, still giving the illusion of a conversation by making the game “Chat” based.
